### Reflection

After finishing with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">all-time famous Web Development Course</a> by Colt Steele, and the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-front-to-back/">MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js</a> by my favorite online instructor Brad Traversy, I wanted to start building something that allowed me to practice my Web Development skills. That was when I tried to take the tech stacks from the later course to re-implement the big project on the first course, and Yelp Camp React was born. The application was a fusion of my two most favorite courses back then.

The most challenging aspect of this project was my unfamiliarity with Javascript higher-order functions(such as `.map()`, `.filter()`, etc.) back then. It was also my mistake that I tried to learn new technologies too fast, without looking back and review what I just learned. Instead, I kept consuming the knowledge passively without actively understanding the reasoning behind certain functionalities. It was not until I tried building a project that I finally realized my mistakes and later tried to understand the basics before moving on to more complicated materials.
